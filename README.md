This repository contains STL files to print Niryo One with a 3D printer.

Note : **You need at least a 200mm\*200mm\*200mm 3D printer to be able to print all the parts.**

-----

**!!! IMPORTANT !!!** A new upgrade (V2.0) for Niryo One is under development and will be released for end of August/beginning of September. It means that the STL parts will be modified, as well as the BOM. Note that this will be the last big upgrade, after that, we won't add any breaking changes.

From September, we'll only sell robots, kits and electronics for the new version. We apologize for any inconvenience if you need to reprint some parts.
